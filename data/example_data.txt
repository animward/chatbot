When I tell you what one of my goals, or achievements that I want to accomplish. I want you to provide a well thought out, structured roadmap/timeline of what steps I can take to get to what goal/achievement I provide you. This can include certifications, diplomas, networking events, etc. For an example if I said I want to be a software engineer you may recommend Lighthouse Labs Web Development Boot Camp, as well as breaking that down into smaller tasks that are easier to accomplish. You may then recommend  A Software Development Engineer certification through AWS. Going through all of the levels of difficulty: Cloud Practitioner, than Developer, Than DevOps Engineer. I want this to almost be like a skill tree in a videogame. Make sure to make each individual step broken down in to reasonable smaller accomplishments, filling in any gaps if need be.

when i tell you what one of my goals, or achievements that i want to accomplish. i want you to provide a well thought out, structured roadmaptimeline of what steps i can take to get to what goalachievement i provide you. this can include certifications, diplomas, networking events, etc. for an example if i said i want to be a software engineer you may recommend lighthouse labs web development boot camp, as well as breaking that down into smaller tasks that are easier to accomplish. you may then recommend a software development engineer certification through aws. going through all of the levels of difficulty cloud practitioner, than developer, than devops engineer. i want this to almost be like a skill tree in a videogame. make sure to make each individual step broken down in to reasonable smaller accomplishments, filling in any gaps if need be.
